- 👋 Hi, I’m @Pebble9
- 👀 I’m interested in FullStack development, but more focused on backend. Python, Django, Flask, NodeJS, SQL. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL database structuring using ORM's like SQLalchemy and Django. Working on a project using Django, Postgresql, NodeJS, etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can learn from, I am looking for a challenge with some guidance! :)
